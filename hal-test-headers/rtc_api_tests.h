/**
 * \defgroup hal_rtc_tests RTC hal requirements and tests
 * The RTC HAL tests ensure driver conformance to defined behavior.
 *
 * To run the RTC hal tests use the command:
 *
 *     mbed test -t <toolchain> -m <target> -n tests-mbed_hal-rtc*
 *
 * # Defined behavior
 * * The function ::rtc_init is safe to call repeatedly - Verified by test ::rtc_init_test
 * * RTC accuracy is at least 10% - Not verified
 * * Init/free doesn't stop RTC from counting - Verified by test ::rtc_persist_test
 * * Software reset doesn't stop RTC from counting - Verified by ::rtc_reset_test
 * * Sleep modes don't stop RTC from counting - Verified by ::rtc_sleep_test
 * * Shutdown mode doesn't stop RTC from counting - Not verified
 *
 * # Undefined behavior
 * * Calling any function other than ::rtc_init before the initialization of the RTC
 *
 * # Potential bugs
 * * Incorrect overflow handling - Verified by ::rtc_range_test
 * * Glitches due to ripple counter - Verified by ::rtc_glitch_test
 *
