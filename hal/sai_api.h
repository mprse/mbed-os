 * \defgroup hal_sai Serial audio interface hal functions
 * Low level interface to the serial audio interface of a target.
 *
 * # Defined behavior
 * * Supports a subset of the possible configuration space - verified by ::sai_
 * * Reports a failure (returns false) upon any invocation to an unsupported feature/parameter - verified by ::sai_
 * * Is able to indicate the currently processed word - verified by ::sai_
 * # Defined behavior if feature supported
 * * Is able to change receiver format without interrupting transmitter format - verified by ::sai_
 * * Is able to change transmitter format without interrupting receiver format - verified by ::sai_
 * * Is able to change transmitter and receiver format without interrupting the current frame - verified by ::sai_
 *
 * @note
 * A transceiver supporting async rx/tx should be considered as 2 different peripherals :
 * - one read-only
 * - one write-only
 * The first allocated channel may or may not limit the second one's feature.
 * eg:
 * In a peripheral that supports async rx/tx but requires format to be the same,
 * the first allocated instance will set the format and tie the second one to this format.
