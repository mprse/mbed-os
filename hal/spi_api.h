 * \defgroup hal_spi Serial Peripheral Interface
 * ## Behaviours
 * ### Defined Behaviours
 *
 * - `spi_get_module()` returns the `SPIName` unique identifier to the peripheral associated to this SPI channel.
 * - `spi_get_capabilities()` fills the given `spi_capabilities_t` instance
 * - `spi_get_capabilities()` should consider the `ssel` pin when evaluation the `support_slave_mode` capability.
 *   If the given `ssel` pin cannot be managed by hardware in slave mode, `support_slave_mode` should be false.
 * - At least a symbol width of 8bit must be supported.
 * - The supported frequency range must include the range [0.2..2] MHz.
 * - The shortest part of the duty cycle must not be shorter than 50% of the expected period.
 * - `spi_init()` initializes the pins leaving the configuration registers unchanged.
 * - `spi_init()` if `is_slave` is false:
 *     - if `ssel` is `NC` the hal implementation ignores this pin.
 *     - if `ssel` is not `NC` then the hal implementation owns the pin and its management.
 * - When managed by the hal implementation, `ssel` is always considered active low.
 * - When managed by the hal implementation, ssel must be asserted for the whole duration of the spi transmission.
 * - When managed by the hal implementation, the delay from the chip select assert to the first clock edge must be at least half spi clock period.
 * - When managed by the hal implementation, the delay from the last clock edge to the chip select de-assert to must be at least half spi clock period.
 * - If hardware can not handle all ssel related requirements, then device capabilities should indicate that ssel cannot be managed by hardware.
 * - When the hardware supports the half-duplex (3-wire) mode, if `miso` (exclusive) or `mosi` is missing in any function that expects pins, the bus is assumed to be half-duplex.
 * - `spi_free()` resets the pins to their default state.
 * - `spi_free()` disables the peripheral clock.
 * - `spi_format()` sets :
 *   - the number of bits per symbol
 *   - the mode :
 *     0. Clock idle state is *low*, data are sampled when the clock becomes *active* (polarity = 0, phase = 0)
 *     1. Clock idle state is *low*, data are sampled when the clock becomes *inactive* (polarity = 0, phase = 1)
 *     2. Clock idle state is *high*, data are sampled when the clock becomes *active* (polarity = 1, phase = 0)
 *     3. Clock idle state is *high*, data are sampled when the clock becomes *inactive* (polarity = 1, phase = 1)
 *   - the bit ordering (lsb/msb first).
 * - `spi_format()` updates the configuration of the peripheral except the baud rate generator.
 * - `spi_frequency()` sets the frequency to use during the transfer.
 * - `spi_frequency()` returns the actual frequency that will be used.
 * - `spi_frequency()` updates the baud rate generator leaving other configurations unchanged.
 * - `spi_transfer()` :
 *   - writes `tx_len` symbols to the bus.
 *   - reads `rx_len` symbols from the bus.
 *   - if `rx` is NULL then inputs are discarded.
 *   - if `tx` is NULL then `fill_symbol` is used instead.
 *   - returns the number of symbol clocked on the bus during this transfer.
 *   - expects symbols types to be the closest stdint type bigger or equal to its size following the platform's endianness.
 *     e.g.:
 *     - 7bits => uint8_t
 *     - 15bits => uint16_t
 *     - 16bits => uint16_t
 *     - 17bits => uint32_t
 *   - In Full-duplex mode :
 *     - if `rx_len` > `tx_len` then it sends `(rx_len-tx_len)` additional `fill_symbol` to the bus.
 *   - In Half-duplex mode :
 *     - as master, `spi_transfer()` sends `tx_len` symbols and then reads `rx_len` symbols.
 *     - as slave, `spi_transfer()` receives `rx_len` symbols and then sends `tx_len` symbols.
 * - `spi_transter_async()` schedules a transfer to be process the same way `spi_transfer()` would have but asynchronously with the following exceptions:
 *   - in async mode only transfers of the same size are allowed (tx size must be equal to rx size)
 *   - async mode only supports full-duplex mode.
 * - `spi_transter_async()` returns immediately with a boolean indicating whether the transfer was successfully scheduled or not.
 * - The callback given to `spi_transfer_async()` is invoked when the transfer completes (with a success or an error).
 * - `spi_transfer_async()` saves the handler and the `ctx` pointer.
 * - The `ctx` is passed to the callback on transfer completion.
 * - Unless if the transfer is aborted, the callback is invoked on completion. The completion maybe when all symbols have been transmitted
 *   or when in slave mode the master de-asserts the chip select.
 * - The `spi_transfer_async()` function may use the `DMAUsage` hint to select the appropriate async algorithm.
 * - The `spi_async_event_t` must be filled with the number of symbol clocked on the bus during this transfer and a boolean value indicated if an error has occurred.
 * - `spi_transfer_async_abort()` aborts an on-going async transfer.
 *
 * ### Undefined Behaviours
 * - Calling `spi_init()` multiple times on the same `spi_t` without `spi_free()`'ing it first.
 * - Calling any method other than `spi_init()` on a non-initialized or freed `spi_t`.
 * - Passing both `miso` and `mosi` as `NC` to `spi_get_module` or `spi_init`.
 * - Passing `miso` or `mosi` as `NC` on target that does not support half-duplex mode.
 * - Passing `mclk` as `NC`  to `spi_get_module` or `spi_init`.
 * - Passing an invalid pointer as `cap` to `spi_get_capabilities`.
 * - Passing pins that cannot be on the same peripheral.
 * - Passing an invalid pointer as `obj` to any method.
 * - Giving a `ssel` pin to `spi_init()` when using in master mode.
 *   SS must be managed by hardware in slave mode and must **NOT** be managed by hardware in master mode.
 * - Setting a frequency outside of the range given by `spi_get_capabilities()`.
 * - Setting a frequency in slave mode.
 * - Setting `bits` in `spi_format` to a value out of the range given by `spi_get_capabilities()`.
 * - Passing an invalid pointer as `fill_symbol` to `spi_transfer` and `spi_transfer_async` while they would be required by the transfer (`rx_len != tx_len` or `tx==NULL`).
 * - Passing an invalid pointer as `handler` to `spi_transfer_async`.
 * - Calling `spi_transfer_async_abort()` while no async transfer is being processed (no transfer or a synchronous transfer).
 * - In half-duplex mode, any mechanism (if any is present) to detect or prevent collision is implementation defined.
 * - Initiating any transfer after `spi_init()` but before both the frequency and format have been set with `spi_frequency()` and `spi_format()`
