/**
 * \defgroup hal_spi SPI: Serial peripheral interface HAL API.
 * Low level interface to the serial peripheral interface of a target.
 *
 * # Programming model
 * This is an OOP like API. spi_t is used a "this".<br/>
 * Methods not having this type as their first parameter are **class** methods.<br/>
 * Methods with an spi_t object as their first parameter are **instance** methods.<br/>
 * `spi_init()` acts as the "constructor"(/initialiser) of this *class*.<br/>
 * `spi_free()` acts as the "destructor"(/deinitialiser) of this *class*.<br/>
 *
 * # Defined behaviours
 * - Multiple instances can share pins such as MISO/MOSI/MCLK but not their SS pin. This pin is used
 *   to distinguish communication channels (master or slaves).
 * - As the instance allocation is at the user's responsibility, the hal implementation cannot keep
 *   a copy of the pointer (keep an alias to the object) as it may be stack allocated and/or moved.
 * - All method must be thread safe at HAL level.
 * - The hal implementation must support both clock phases.
 * - The hal implementation must support both clock polarities.
 * - The hal implementation must support either master or slave or both modes.
 * - The hal implementation must support either lsb first or msb first or both bit ordering.
 * - The hal implementation must support either continuous or noncontinuous or both modes.
 * - The hal implementation must support at least 1 word length in the range 4 to 32.
 * - The hal implementation must support the simplex and full duplex modes.
 * - The hal implementation may or may not support the half-duplex, dual and/or quad-io modes.
 * - The accuracy of the clock generated in master mode by the hal implementation must be within +/-
 *   0.1% of the user requested frequency.
 *
 * - spi_get_capabilities(..)
 *   - returns NULL if passed a NULL pointer.
 *   - returns NULL if the peripheral cannot be identified.
 *   - returns a constant pointer to a constant structure describing the capabilities of the
 *     related peripheral.
 *   - returned value is independent from the SPI channel usage.
 * - spi_init(..)
 *   - returns SPI_RESULT_INVALID_PARAM if any of the parameters is NULL.
 *   - returns SPI_RESULT_DEVICE_BUSY if the identifying set of pin is already associated to an
 *     instance of spi_t.
 *   - returns SPI_RESULT_CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED if the device can not achieve the requested parameters
 *     (Frequency, mode ...).
 *   - returns SPI_RESULT_OK if the device device was associated successfully to the object.
 * - spi_transfer(..)
 *   - returns `true` if the operation succeeded.
 *   - returns `false` if any of the parameters is NULL.
 *   - returns `false` if the peripheral is busy with another transaction.
 *   - returns `false` if an error occurred. An error can be due to :
 *     - conflicting master ;
 *     - rx or tx overflow ;
 *     - rx or tx underflow...
 *   - sends and received up to `max(tx_count, rx_count)`.
 *   - if `tx` is not NULL then writes up to `tx_count` symbol from `tx` then sends
 *     `max(tx_count, rx_count) - tx_count` times the `fill_symbol` .
 *   - if `rx` is not NULL then stores in `rx` up to `rx_count` symbol and continue popping symbol
 *     from the peripheral until `max(tx_count, rx_count) - rx_count` is reached. All spare symbol
 *     are dropped.
 *   - if the device is available, it locks the device and blocks until completion (or error).
 * - spi_free(..)
 *   - does nothing if passed a NULL pointer.
 *   - cancel all pending or on going transaction/transfer and then deinitialise (clock out) this
 *     device if it was the last device associated to this peripheral.
 * - spi_data_available(..)
 *   - returns false if passed a NULL pointer.
 *   - in master mode, returns false.
 *   - in slave mode, returns true if data is available for read.
 *
 * # Undefined behaviours
 * - calling any instance method before `spi_init()`.
 * - calling any other instance method than `spi_init()` after `spi_free()`.
 * - calling free on a spi_t instance being used in a `spi_transfer()` call.
 *
 * # Lexicon
 * ## Transfer/Transaction
 * In this documentation a *transfer* is an operation of emission, reception or both that occur
 * during a single call to spi_transfer().
 *
 * ## Continuous mode
 * In this mode SS is kept asserted between words. For example with 4 bits words msb first,
 * continuous mode would transmit 5 symbols: 0x9 0x4 0x8 0xF 0x0
 * ```
 *        ___   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _
 * MCLK      \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/
 *        _                                                                                 _
 * SS      \_______________________________________________________________________________/
 *        _ ___         ___     ___         ___             _______________                 _
 * DATA   _X   \_______/   \___/   \_______/   \___________/               \_______________X_
 * _
 * ```
 * where non-continuous mode would require a "pause" of a defined duration between symbols thus
 * reducing the overall throughput of the bus : 0x9 0x9 0x3 0x8
 * ```
 *        ___   _   _   _   _  ___   _   _   _   _  ___   _   _   _   _  ___   _   _   _   __
 * MCLK      \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ --   \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ --   \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ --   \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/
 *        _                 _  _                 _  _                 _  _                 __
 * SS      \_______________/ -- \_______________/ -- \_______________/ -- \_______________/
 *        _ ___         _____  _____         _____  _         _________  _____             __
 * DATA   _X   \_______/   X_--_X   \_______/   X_--_X_______/       X_--_X   \___________X__
 * _
 * ```
 * ## Symbol/Word
 * Even though documentations usually uses the lexeme `word` to mean the unit of data that is
 * sent/received it is ambiguous as it may not correspond to an actual `word` on the platform.
 * To avoid any confusion we will use in this API the lexeme `symbol` instead.
 * ##Â SPI channel
 * This is the virtual communication channel created between a master and its slave.
